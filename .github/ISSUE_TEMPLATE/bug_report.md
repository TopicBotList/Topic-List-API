**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behaviour**
Some stuff such as the Owner and Token will show up as quotation signs. This is done to ensure the token of an individual doesn't get leaked thus resulting in fraudulent behavior or changes in their account and other things. Some routes also don't give a json response because they are handled internally.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
